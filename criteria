Probably the biggest question is what language we want to use.  We'll be
spending a huge amount of time writing whatever it is.  We need some criteria:

 * how easy is the language to learn for people accustomed to C
 * does the language has an object system?  We'll be implementing cmop (6model)
   in it, so the object system needs to be either self-hosting or non-existent
 * how efficiently does the language map to M0?  We want to generate efficient
   M0 and to have a clear idea of what the M0 for a given snippet looks like
 * it shouldn't allow things that don't make sense in M0 (not sure what this means)
 * the language should allow CPS stuff, either directly or indirectly.
   Indirectly is probably easier.
 * need distinction between compile-time and runtime constructs
 * need typed variables
 * something struct-like
 * a way to define M1 ops composed from M0 ops
 * light syntax, easy to implement, no optimizations
 * if we want macros, they need to be way smaller than C's
